Autori: Sadeghi H, Seif F, Khanmohammadi S
Rezumat:
Secondary cancers (SCs) following radiotherapy (RT) represent a significant long-term risk of cancer survivors, necessitating accurate predictive models for early intervention. This study developed a machine learning (ML) model integrating clinical, pathological, and genomic data to predict SC incidence. The model leverages a dataset of 1,240 patients from population-based registries and clinical cohorts, incorporating features such as radiation dose, age at exposure, histology, and mutations (e.g., TP53, BRCA1/2). A Random Forest (RF) regression achieved perfect performance metrics (MSE = 0.002, [Formula: see text]-squared = 0.98), with radiation dose (Gini importance = 0.42) and age at exposure (Gini importance = 0.38) identified as the most critical predictors. Predicted incidence rates for new patients, such as 15.2 per 10,000 for breast-to-lung SCs, are consistent with epidemiological trends. The model's impressive performance highlights its potential for accurately predicting SC, underscoring its utility in clinical settings for early detection and predictions for new patients. This study highlights the potential of ML in personalized oncology while emphasizing caution in interpreting overly optimistic metrics.

Rezumat:
Accumulation of genetic mutations in malignant myeloid precursor cells leads to an extremely poor prognosis for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immunogenic neoantigens recognized by T cell receptor (TCR) can elicit effective immune responses against malignant cells with corresponding somatic mutations. To broaden the range of targeted treatments for AML, in this study, we explored the feasibility of immunotherapy targeting neoantigens arising from recurrent mutations, which are exclusively present on leukemic cells. We used data-driven methods to select seven neoantigens from four frequently mutated genes (NPM1, FLT3, TP53, and DNMT3A) associated with HLA-A<sup>*</sup>02:01-positive AML patients. Functional assays demonstrated that neoantigens derived from NPM1/W288fs, FLT3/D835H, and FLT3/D835Y were shown to induce specific T cell responses in AML patients. We further identified the specific TCR sequences from healthy donors capable of recognizing these neoantigens. In-depth studies of their specific T cells revealed the presence of dominant αβTCRs that could specifically recognize NPM1/W288fs and FLT3/D835H in an HLA-A<sup>*</sup>02:01-restricted manner. T cells engineered with each αβTCR selectively recognized and killed HLA-A<sup>*</sup>02:01-positive AML targets endogenously expressing corresponding mutations. Overall, our findings support the clinical translation of adoptive neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered T cells as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating AML.

Tumor protein p53 (TP53) plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining genomic stability, making TP53-mediated cell death an important diagnostic marker for breast cancer therapy. This review compiles laboratory methodologies for the application of TP53 apoptosis assays to standard clinical specimens. Modern diagnostic techniques enhance the management of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh-frozen (FF) samples, as well as liquid biopsy systems, to preserve nucleic acid integrity for subsequent analysis. Analytical platforms, including targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), and multiplex reverse transcription (RT), exhibit high sensitivity, achieving detection limits below 0.5 % variant allele fraction (VAF), and are supported by orthogonal confirmation methods. Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays employing proteins such as p53, BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), and cleaved caspase-3 provide quantifiable indicators of apoptosis in standard pathological sample. Integrating genomic variants with pathway-level signatures enhances the clinical interpretation of prognosis, therapeutic decision-making, and monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). Achieving laboratory accreditation necessitates the implementation of standardized preanalytical controls, validation of methods with clearly defined analytical performance criteria, and establishment of consistent reporting systems. In metastatic disease cases, there is an 87 % concordance between tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) across various platforms, supporting its clinical application. This approach translates TP53-apoptosis data from research tools into validated tests for clinical application in breast cancer treatment and future research initiatives.

Titlu: Investigating Genomic Differences by Ethnicity in Breast, Colorectal and Prostate Cancers: Secondary Data Analysis of the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Database.
Autori: Carr J, Faghy MA, Broom D, Ashton REM
Rezumat:
Globally, millions of cancer cases are diagnosed annually and mortality rates continue to rise with breast (BC), colorectal (CRC) and prostate (PC) cancer among the most prevalent. Race and ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes have been well-documented; however, the underlying factors contributing to these disparities are currently unknown. This study utilised the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Portal, a publicly accessible repository, therefore ethical approval was not required. Cancer incidence data were collected by prevalent gene mutations associated with BC, CRC and PC within White, Black and Asian populations. Rolling one-year survival rates were constructed for each genetic mutation. For BC, Black and Asian individuals exhibited higher percentages of cases associated with TP53 mutations compared to Whites. CRC incidence showed Black individuals exhibited higher percentages of cases associated with APC, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations compared to Whites and Asians. PC incidence demonstrated that Black individuals had elevated percentages of cases associated with SPOP, ATM and SYNE1 mutations compared to Whites and Asians. Asian individuals displayed significantly lower survival percentages over 10 years compared to White and Black populations across genetic mutations associated with BC. White individuals exhibited significantly higher survival percentages over 10 years compared to Black individuals across genetic mutations associated with CRC. Significant disparities exist in cancer incidence and survival rates across White, Black and Asian populations. These findings demonstrate the importance of targeted approaches in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment to address disparities and the need for equitable healthcare. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms driving such disparities and to develop effective strategies to improve cancer outcomes across diverse ethnic populations.

Titlu: Genetic Variation in Background Mucosa Across Different Grades of Chronic Esophagitis.

Rezumat:
The risk of cancer in chronic esophagitis varies by the number of Lugol's voiding lesions (LVLs). However, how these mutations differ by LVLs grade remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the genetic characteristics of the background mucosa by LVLs grade with a history of endoscopic treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or squamous dysplasia (SD). A total of 34 patients (28 ESCC, 6 SD) were classified by LVLs grade. Tissues from ESCC/SD and background mucosa were taken endoscopically, and DNA was extracted. Somatic mutations were identified in the esophageal cancer panel. For each mutation, putative drivers were identified by OncoKB, and the gene mutation patterns were compared among the grades. There were LVLs grade B/C = 14/20 cases. Somatic mutation of TP53 was found significantly more frequently in the LVLs than in the background mucosa (88.2% vs. 64.7%, p = 0.043, Fisher's exact test). Somatic mutations of NOTCH1, including putative drivers, were more frequent in the background mucosa than in ESCC/SD (82.3% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.002, Fisher's exact test). There was no significant difference in the percentage of putative drivers of TP53 and NOTCH1 in the background mucosa by LVLs grade B/C (50.0% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.487; 7.1% vs. 5.0%, p = 1.000, Fisher's exact test). Regardless of LVLs grade, the background mucosa of patients with chronic esophagitis who already had ESCC or SD had already accumulated the same level of TP53 gene mutations. Even patients with LVLs grade B chronic esophagitis should undergo regular endoscopic examination for early detection of ESCC.
